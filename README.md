# LE2 Liara squadmate

Mod that adds Liara from Lair of the Shadow Broker as a selectable squadmate to Mass Effect 2 in the Mass Effect Legendary Edition.
Uses LotSB both as recruitment and loyalty mission and enables Liara to be selected from the squad selection screen
like any other ME2 squadmate, this includes the loadout selection and power level-up screen. As this uses Liara as
defined by LotSB it matches the DLC both in appearance and gameplay in terms of what loadouts and powers are available
and how they function.

## Installation

Installed via ME3 Tweaks Mod Manager as DLC mod. Note that this mod changes a lot of files, so conflicts with other mods
are probable. However, the majority of files were generated by the auto_patcher tool, which can be used to apply the
necessary changes to your already modded files. If a file exists in several DLC directories, it uses the DLC with the
highest mount priority (not including this mod itself of course). So to apply changes to a file from a different mod,
make sure the mod has a higher mount priority than the base game DLCs (should be the case anyway) but a lower mount
priority than this DLC (10900), as the modded file will be copied to this mod's directory.

## Implementation details

The majority of package files have been modded automatically using the auto_patcher tool. This tool mods the following
sequences automatically:

 - LookupHenchmanFromPlotManager: loads plot bool for squad selection and triggers spawns for selected members, call global hench spawn handling with hench ID 14 for Liara
 - IsTag_Henchman: determines whether the tag of an object represents a henchman / squad made, required in many places including cutscenes
 - Store_the_Henchmen_in_the_Squad: stores which squadmates were in the squad when temporarily clearing the squad, e.g. when getting in a hammerhead
 - Retrieve_the_Henchmen_previously_in_the_Squad: retrieves the members stored by Store_the_Henchmen_in_the_Squad
 - The unnamed sequences that follow LookupHenchmanFromPlotManager to invoke plot transitions to set members in squad

Additionally, the tool also automatically replaces the following plot transition invocations:

 - 75 In_Squad.Clear_Squad is replaced by 10934 to also clear Liara
 - 1910 Was_In_Squad.Clear_all is replaced by 10933
 
See Plot transitions / state events section.

### The following packages were modded manually:

 - BioP_Global.pcc
   - Expand sequence `Create_Henchmen` to handle Liara by enabling StreamingState "stream_liara_00" when in squad.
   - Add additional output link to sequences `SpawnHenchman_0` and `SpawnHenchman_1` in order to invoke sequence `Create_Henchmen` with label "Liara" for hench ID 14.
 - BioH_SelectGUI.pcc
   - Mod squad selection GUI in `GUI_SF_TeamSelect.TeamSelect` to add Liara using ME3's portrait textures.
   - Add loadout info for Liara to `m_lstLoadouts` in `SFXGameContent.Default__BioSeqAct_ShowPartySelectionGUI`.
 - Lair of the Shadow Broker: BioP_Exp1Lvl2.pcc, BioP_Exp1Lvl3.pcc and BioP_Exp1Lvl4.pcc
   - Mirror changes to `GUI_SF_TeamSelect` from `BioH_SelectGUI`.
   - Remove special handling for Liara from sequence `REF_Henchmen_PlaceOnceInMasterMap` and adjust `LookupHenchmanFromPlotManager` sequence analogous to rest of game to handle Liara globally instead.
 - BioH_Liara_00.pcc
   - Adjust AddHenchmenToSquad RemoteEvent sequence to check whether Liara is actually in squad before adding to party analogous to other squadmates, was not required for LotSB.
 - BioH_END_Liara_00.pcc
   - Based on BioH_Liara_00.pcc with special handling in spawn sequence for the suicide mission analogous to other squadmates.
 - Special cutscene in Overlord DLC on vulkan station: BioD_Unc1Base2_01Narrative_LOC_INT.pcc (and the other localised files)

## Mod info

The mod adds DLC `DLC_MOD_LiaraSquad` with mount priority 10900 and uses values in the range of 109XX for any new
plot variables, transitions, coniditionals etc.

## Plot variables

| Tag                | Plot variable | Desc                      |
| ------------------ | ------------- | ------------------------- |
| InSquadLiara       | 6879          | LiaraInSquad (LotSB)      |
| InPartyLiara       | 6961          | Started_Car_Chase (LotSB) |
| IsSelectableLiara  | 6951          | End_Mission (LotSB)       |
| IsLoyalLiara       | 6951          | End_Mission (LotSB)       |
| IsSpecializedLiara | 10912         | (new plot bool)           |
| WasLoyalLiara      | 10913         | (new plot bool)           |
| KnowExistLiara     | 6961          | Started_Car_Chase (LotSB) |
| AppearanceLiara    | 10914         | (new plot int, unused)    |
| WasInSquadLiara    | 10915         | (new plot bool)           |

Started_Car_Chase is used for InPartyLiara and KnowExistLiara to make sure Liara appears in the squad selection screen
during LotSB (there is a squad selection screen before reaching the Shadow Broker ship). Note that IsSelectableLiara is
enabled later by 6951 (End_Mission), which means after LotSB has been completed, guaranteeing that Liara cannot be deselected
during LotSB, similar to how loyalty missions work.

## Plot transitions / state events

| State Event | Desc                                                          |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 10931       | Set 6879 (LiaraInSquad) to true                               |
| 10932       | Set 10915 (WasInSquadLiara) to true                           |
| 10933       | Expansion of 1910 (Was_In_Squad.Clear_all) that handles Liara |
| 10934       | Expansion of 75 (In_Squad.Clear_Squad) that handles Liara     |

## Merge mods

The function `BioSeqAct_SetPlotPartySize.Activate` from SFXGame.pcc is modded via merge mod `MergeMods/merge-mods_manifest.json` to increment
plot int 22 (Party_Size) for Liara if plot bool 6961 (InPartyLiara / Started_Car_Chase (LotSB)) is set.
